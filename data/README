In this project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of sports articles from The New Times. The project was structured in two main phases:

Web Scraping: Using Python and BeautifulSoup, we collected raw sports-related article data.
Data Cleaning and Visualization: We processed the collected data for analysis, cleaned the text, and visualized.

this website of New Times Sports is containing the more information about the job subscribers and other things but we need especially those words related to sports only.
here our Data Cleaning Process
We performed several steps to prepare the scraped data for analysis:

Removed punctuation and special characters
Normalized whitespace
Converted all text to lowercase
